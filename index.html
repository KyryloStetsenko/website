  <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A seasoned professional BA of the <i>generalist</i> type with <span class="highlighted">15 years</span> in the software development industry.</li>
    <li>Played roles: <i>ICT Business Analyst</i>, <i>Product Owner</i>, <i>Product Manager</i>, <i>Technical Consultant</i>.</li>
    <li>Adept at entering new subject domains and environments, <span class="highlighted">quickly adapting</span>, and making impact while learning by doing.</li>
    <li>My ways of working got tested through many projects in various domains, in <span class="highlighted">different industry sectors</span>: engagement banking, financial trading, conversational AI, corporate IT infrastructure and compliance, HR processes, sales processes, retail- and investment banking, (re)insurance, e-learning, e-commerce, e-document workflow, retail, freight transportation, healthcare, and more.</li>
    <li>My <span class="highlighted">communication skills</span> were honed through 70+ missions for customers from all over the world: USA, Canada, UK, EU, Middle East, Japan. Many missions included long onsite activities.</li>
    <li>Proven ability to <span class="highlighted">empathise a nuanced business context</span> helped me in building rapport with stakeholders of different backgrounds and calibres: from a “C-level officer at a multi-billion-dollar corporation” to an “individual entrepreneur”.</li>
    <li>My <span class="highlighted">working products</span> - depending on customer needs - usually include such artefacts as: documented product/solution vision, business model canvas, business case, product development roadmap, well-refined product backlog, “As-Is” and “To-Be” business process descriptions, software requirements specification, lots of diagrams (BPMN, UML, DFD, IDEF0, etc.), marketing documents (e.g. a one-pager for a startup presentation). Some of my artefacts have been used for raising startup investments and launching corporate internal innovations.</li>
    <li>Proven ability to establish ways of working in any <span class="highlighted">agile-flavoured environment</span> (Scrum, Kanban, Pivotal XP). In mixed roles (such as Product Manager + Scrum Master), I leverage my personality facets as a human being to drive teamwork and foster team chemistry.</li>
    <li>When the project success requires it, I don’t hesitate to roll up my sleeves and dig deeper: explore a database with SQL queries, analyse XML with XPath, specify RESTful API contract, make a sample JSON for developers, inspect HTML/CSS/JS code to support troubleshooting at UAT, write a Python script for web-scraping to supply developers with a real data CSV-file and more. That <span class="highlighted">reasonable level of technicality</span> helps me a lot in empathising with my technical teammates (system architects, devs, QAs, devops), fostering stronger rapport and enhancing team cohesion.</li>
  </ul>
